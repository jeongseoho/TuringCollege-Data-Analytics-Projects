## Project description

#### You are probably becoming more and more aware that you can find data pretty much everywhere. Any time you observe and evaluate something in the world, you are collecting and analyzing data. Your analysis helps you to find easier ways of doing things, to identify patterns, to save your time and to discover surprising new perspectives that can completely change the way you experience things. The six steps of the data analysis process that you have been learning in this program are: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. You will have to apply these six steps in your first practical project.

#### There are two main goals of this first project. The first one is to get a more intuitive feeling about the mentioned steps of data analysis by trying to do a simple task in practice. The most important is that you would understand the aim and the process of data analysis. The aim is to solve a problem and the result is the data driven solution. So the process of data analysis is in between. Your project must have those parts and you should follow the steps of a structured approach to data analysis. The task is divided into these six steps to guide you, but read everything carefully before you start. All parts are connected to each other, so get the full picture first.

#### The second goal is to learn how the project reviews work in Turing College. You will get to schedule a project review, talk with an STL in a 1-1 call and get personalized feedback from them. Be sure to use this opportunity to ask the STL any questions that you are curious about!
